Mage Porob is our new open and collaborative project to create arguably the first ever Unicode-compliant and openly-licensed typeface. A cross-platform input tool will be clubbed along with the typeface so that anyone, irrespective of their operating system can write a blog in Warang Citi or share a post on social media, and a user manual will be created for the new users to learn how to type. All of these will be licensed under a free license which means that the font and the input tools will be Open Source software, and all the documentations will be licensed under a Creative Commons license.
