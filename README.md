### Warang Citi typeface, cross-platform input tools, Open Educational Resources and Methodologies

**Mage Porob** is an open and collaborative project that aims at building a multiscript typeface licensed under the Open Font License (OFL) that can will contain glyphs of Warang Citiâ€”a writing system used for the Indian indigenous language Ho, Odia, and Latin. The project will also have an Open Source cross-platform input method, and user manuals and other educational documentations under a CC0 or CC-BY 3.0 license.

A cross-platform input tool will be clubbed along with the typeface so that anyone, irrespective of their operating system can write a blog in Warang Citi or share a post on social media, and a user manual will be created for the new users to learn how to type. All of these will be licensed under a free license which means that the font and the input tools will be Open Source software, and all the documentations will be licensed under a Creative Commons license.
